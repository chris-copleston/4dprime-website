### SPAM and Unsolicited Email

4DPrime takes a zero tolerance approach to the sending of Unsolicited Email (SPAM). Very simply this means that Clients of 4DPrime may not use or permit others to use our service for sending SPAM Emails. Clients of 4DPrime may not host, or permit hosting of information that is advertised by SPAM from other services. Violations of this policy carry severe penalties, including termination of service.

If a customer is found to be in violation of our SPAM policy, 4DPrime may, at its sole discretion, restrict, suspend or terminate a customer's account. In addition, 4DPrime may impose a Â£100 penalty for each spam policy violation. 4DPrime solely reserves the right to refuse or cancel service to known spammers. Lastly, 4DPrime reserves the right to determine what violates this policy. As such, any violation may result in cancellation of services without refund.

### Network Security

Customers may not use the 4DPrime Network to attempt to circumvent user authentication or security of any host, network, or account. This includes, but is not limited to, accessing data not intended for the customer, logging into a server or account the customer is not expressly authorized to access, password cracking, probing the security of other networks in search of weakness, or violation of any other organization's security policy. Customers may not attempt to interfere or deny service to any user, host, or network. This includes, but is not limited to, flooding, mail bombing, or other deliberate attempts to overload or crash a host or network. 4DPrime will cooperate fully with investigations of violations of systems or network security at other sites, including cooperating with law enforcement authorities in the investigation of suspected criminal violations. Users who violate system or network security may incur criminal or civil liability.

### Cancellations

Requests for cancellation must be submitted via a written notice (email or letter) and must include the date you would like us to terminate our services which should not be sooner than our standard notice period. Your cancellation will be confirmed by email. Once an account has been terminated we do not retain any data or backups.

#### Standard Notice Period

4DPrime requires a one calendar month notice period for cancellation of your account. Cancellation must be received at least one calendar month before your next invoice due date. 4DPrime will then stop all recurring invoicing and you will not be charged again. Any invoices due within the notice period, or overdue invoices on your account must be paid in full prior to cancellation.

### Refunds and Disputes

All payments to 4DPrime are non-refundable. This includes any setup fee and subsequent charges regardless of usage. If you dispute a charge that, in 4DPrime's sole discretion is a valid charge under the provisions of this TOS, you agree to pay 4DPrime an Administrative Fee for costs associated with pursuing that payment.

4DPrime does not offer any kind of "money back guarantee" or initial "trial period".

All domain name registration fees are non-refundable, in whole or in part, even if your domain name registration is suspended, cancelled or transferred prior to the end of your term. Please be careful when ordering as spelling mistakes and 'typos' cannot be corrected or refunded.

### VAT and Payment Currency

VAT will be chargeable to UK and EU clients. VAT is not applicable to clients in the rest of the world.

If you are a VAT registered business in another EU member state then you must supply your VAT registration number for VAT to be zero-rated. If your VAT registration number is not supplied or cannot be confirmed as valid then VAT at the UK rate will apply.

### Invoicing

4DPrime does not provide paper or hard-copy invoices. PDF invoices are sent via email. Overdue invoices will incur current bank rate interest charges plus 2%.

### Domain Name Expiry and Redemption Fee's

4DPrime is not liable for expiry or loss of your domain name.

We strongly recommend keeping an eye on your renewal dates. On the date a domain expires it will be deactivated by the registry and no longer display your website. Once a domain is deactivated upon expiry you will typically have somewhere between 5 and 30 days to contact us to renew the domain name at our regular renewal rates before it drops into "redemption period" where the cost to renew then increases substantially. Note that some registries (such as .EU) place an expired domain into redemption immediately.

Redemption Period - Once a domain is in the "redemption period" the cost to renew it increases. This is a cost charged by the registry and passed on to you by us. Redemption periods last between 30 and 60 days and then the domain is released to the public so anyone can re-register your domain and you will lose it.

### Domain Transfers

Any domain name registered by 4DPrime (as your registrar) is yours to keep. You can transfer your domain name to a different registrar at any time once the domain is 90 days old - Newly registered domains do have a 90 day waiting period where they cannot be transferred from 4DPrime to a different registrar.

The same 90 day 'no transfer' window applies when an expired domain is renewed or restored after being in the registry redemption period. Once 90 days have passed from renewing such domains they are then free to be transferred again.

Premium and Reserved Domains

Some domain names are classed as "premium" by the registries that operate them and although they may show up in availability results they cannot be registered at our usual rates. Similarly some registries reserve domains so they may only be registered under certain conditions that are checked after placing an order. If you attempt to register a domain name that is either premium or reserved then our sales team will contact you as the order may need to be cancelled or further details discussed.

### Abuse

Any attempts to undermine, slander, libel, threaten, or cause harm to a 4DPrime server, customer, employee, or the company directly is strictly prohibited and is grounds for immediate termination without refund. In addition, we will pursue all attempts to the fullest extent of the law.

### Refusal of Service

4DPrime reserves the right at its sole discretion to refuse or cancel service. Violation of any of 4DPrime's TOS could result in a warning, suspension, or account termination. Accounts terminated due to policy violations will not be refunded. Domains terminated due to policy violations will not be released to the customer.

### Information Disclosure Policy

4DPrime will not otherwise disclose its customers' personal and account information unless 4DPrime has reason to believe that disclosing such information is necessary to identify, make contact with, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing harm or interfering with the rights or property of 4DPrime, 4DPrime' customers, or others, or where 4DPrime has a good faith belief that the law requires such disclosure.
