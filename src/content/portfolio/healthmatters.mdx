This practice cultivates mindful eating habits, promotes balanced nutrition aids in maintaining a healthy weight.

Understanding and tracking Body Mass Index (BMI) is important for maintaining a healthy weight. By regularly monitoring BMI, users can assess their level of body fat and identify whether they fall within a healthy range.
Tracking BMI provides motivation to engage in activities that promote weight management and reduce the risk of obesity-related health issues.

Keeping a record of glucose levels helps individuals make appropriate dietary choices, manage medication and insulin dosage and recognize patterns that can impact overall health and well-being.
